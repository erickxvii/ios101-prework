## Features  
The following **required** functionality is completed:  
- Users see a screen with three labels and a button.  
- Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color.

## Challenges  
While creating this app, I struggled immensely with navigating through Xcode. Since I had very little experience with the IDE, it was a steep learning curve. Additionally, I had to use another MacBook because my personal laptop could not run Xcode.

## Ideas for Improvement  
Here are some ideas to enhance the app in the future:  
- Improve the UI with custom fonts, colors, and layouts.  
- Add a feature to change the text color dynamically.  
- Include an image view to display a profile picture or logo.  
- Allow users to input custom text via a text field.
